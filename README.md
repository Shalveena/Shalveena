👋 Hi, I’m @Shalveena!

### 👀 A bit about me

I’m a front-end developer with a passion for collaborative creation. My love of learning and curiosity, coupled with an appetite for challenges led me to switch careers from law to software development. I have just finished an intensive, 13-week bootcamp learning the fundamentals of web development, which was just the beginning. I have so much more to explore and learn, and I am excited to see where this path leads.

### 🌱 What I'm learning

I’m currently learning React and practicing JavaScript to get better and better 😊
