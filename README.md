ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shalveena!

### ðŸ‘€ A bit about me

Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a passion for collaborative creation. My love of learning and curiosity, coupled with an appetite for challenges led me to switch careers from law to software development. I have just finished an intensive, 13-week bootcamp learning the fundamentals of web development, which was just the beginning. I have so much more to explore and learn, and I am excited to see where this path leads.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm learning

Iâ€™m currently learning React and practicing JavaScript to get better and better ðŸ˜Š
